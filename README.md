# shinygains: An Interactive Demonstration of the suddengains R Package

This Shiny App demonstrates the main functions of the suddengains R Package.

At the moment it is possible to:
- **Identify** sudden gains/losses in example data sets
- **Check** a specific sequence of six consecutive measurement points for sudden gains/losses

This is work in progress and feedback is very welcome.
The code of the R package [suddengains](https://github.com/milanwiedemann/suddengains) and [this shiny application](https://github.com/milanwiedemann/shinygains) can be found on GitHub.
